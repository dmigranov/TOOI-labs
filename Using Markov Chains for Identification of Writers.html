</p><h2> Abstract</h2>
  In this paper we present a technique for authorship attribution
  based on a simple Markov chain of letters (i.e., just letter bigrams
  are used). Many proposed methods of authorship attribution are
  illustrated on small examples. We show that this technique provides
  excellent results when applied to over 380 texts from the Project
  Gutenberg archives, as well as to two previously published data
  sets.

1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</h2>
Modern methods of authorship attribution are reviewed for Russian
techniques by Milov (1994) and for Western methods by Holmes
(1998). Despite the huge variety of
methods, none of those described in either paper have been applied to
a large number of texts. Often such methods require an element of
human intervention which makes their application to large numbers of
texts almost impossible. Yet the generalisability of these techniques
is of prime importance - can they be used outside the particular
case that they were designed for?

<p>
One method which has been tested on a number of texts was proposed by
Fomenko and Fomenko (1996). They examine the proportion of function
words used by an author, and find that this is stable for each author,
across a large number of writers in Russian.

</p><p>
In this paper we present a method which has its origins in the early
twentieth century in the work of Markov (1916). In criticising the
work of Morozov (1915), he recalls a technique used to examine the
text of <em>Eugene Onegin </em> in 1913.
 In Markov's paper we find the
first application of the idea of the <em>Markov Chain </em>, used in
many fields today, e.g. speech recognition. We consider a
straightforward measure, i.e. the letters that are used in the text.
Unlike recent work involving letters by, for example Kjell (1994) and
Forsyth and Holmes (1996), we consider not the relative frequency of a
letter bigram, but rather the probabilities of the subsequent letter,
e.g.  given that a particular letter is an `f' which letters are most
likely to follow it?

</p><p>
In the following section we describe the method in detail. Subsequent
sections put the idea in to practice with a large selection of texts
from the Project Gutenberg archives, data from Baayen et al.&nbsp;(1996)'s
investigation of the use of syntactic information, and from The <em>
  Federalist Papers </em>. We finish with the conclusions drawn from
these examples.

</p><p>
        </p><h2><a name="tth_sEc2">
2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Method</h2>

<p>
If we wanted to find a probabilistic model for natural language text,
we might consider a simple model where letters and spaces were
generated independently according to their probabilities of occurrence
in the language. Of course, letters do not occur at random, and are
dependent on the letters which occur before them. The simplest such
model would have each letter being dependent only on the preceding
letter. This gives rise to a first-order, or simple, Markov chain
model. We will show that this model can be used to determine authorship
in a wide variety of examples.

</p><p>
As an example of a first-order Markov chain, we can consider a
sequence of a reduced number of letters, for example a section of DNA.
The section below is taken from the start of the X-chromosome.

</p><p>

</p><pre>GATCATTGATATGTTGCTAGAACTATGAGTGTTAAAGGTGCTTGTGGTGAGTTATCAGAC
AGAAACGCAGAAGATGTTATTGGAAGCTTGAGGAAAAGTGATCCTGGATTTACAGTGCCA
AGAATTGGCCTGTATTGTGTTCTCAATGTTTTTGAGGAAGGTAGAAACTGTAAGTGATGA
</pre>

<p>
In this case we have four possible characters, A, C, G and T. If we
count the number of times in this section of DNA that A occurs, we
find that of the 53 occurrences, A is followed by another A 17 times,
or 32.1% of the time, while a C follows only 5 times (9.4%), a G, 17
times (32.1%) and a T 14 times or 26.4%. We can then construct a
full <em>transition matrix</em>:

</p><p>

</p><center>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td></td><td align="right"></td><td colspan="4" align="center">Second char</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td align="right"></td><td align="right">A</td><td align="right">C</td><td align="right">G</td><td align="right">T</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td align="right">A </td><td align="right">17  </td><td align="right">5  </td><td align="right">17  </td><td align="right">14 </td></tr>
<tr><td>First</td><td align="right">C </td><td align="right">7  </td><td align="right">3  </td><td align="right">1  </td><td align="right">8 </td></tr>
<tr><td>char</td><td align="right">G </td><td align="right">20  </td><td align="right">6  </td><td align="right">8  </td><td align="right">17 </td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td align="right">T </td><td align="right">10  </td><td align="right">5  </td><td align="right">24  </td><td align="right">17 </td></tr></tbody></table>
</center>

<p>
This can be turned into a matrix of probabilities by dividing each
number by the total for that row, e.g. for A followed by another A we
have 17/(17+5+17+14) = 0.320755:

</p><p>

<tr><td>First</td><td align="right">C </td><td align="right">0.368421  </td><td align="right">0.157895  </td><td align="right">0.052632  </td><td align="right">0.421053 </td></tr>
<tr><td>char</td><td align="right">G </td><td align="right">0.392157  </td><td align="right">0.117647  </td><td align="right">0.156863  </td><td align="right">0.333333 </td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td align="right">T </td><td align="right">0.178571  </td><td align="right">0.089286  </td><td align="right">0.428571  </td><td align="right">0.303571 </td></tr></tbody></table>
</center>

<p>
While in studies of DNA the alphabet consists of 4 characters, with
texts in English we have 26 characters, plus the space character, to deal
with. The theory remains the same, with a 27&#215;27 transition matrix
replacing the 4&#215;4 one illustrated above.

</p><p>
Some pre-processing of the texts is carried out before the transition
matrices are calculated. All punctuation and formatting are removed.
Khmelev (2000) shows that better results are obtained when capitalised
words such as proper nouns and sentence-initial words are ignored and
so words beginning with a capital letter are also omitted. Formatting
is reduced to a single space between words, and also at the beginning
and end of the text. A mathematical description of the technique can
be found in Appendix <a href="#app:math">A</a> while the main text will describe
it in general terms.

</p><p>
A transition matrix, comparable to the one above, although much
larger, is then calculated for each text. The transition matrix for an
author is produced by averaging the elements of the matrices from each
text by that author.

</p><p>
In order to predict the authorship of a new text, assuming that it was
written by one of the known authors, we consider the probability of
the text being generated by each of the transition matrices. Each
author will thus be assigned a probability. These probabilities are
then ranked, with the highest probability having rank 0, the next rank
1 and so on, and the author with the highest probability and thus
lowest rank is deemed to have written the text.

</p><p>
Khmelev (2000) presents this technique and applies it to authors writing in
Russian. He shows that it gives substantially
better results than the analysis of individual letters.  In the
present paper we apply the method to English texts including two
published data sets.

</p><p>

3.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Project Gutenberg</h3>
In order to consider as wide a variety of writers in English as
possible, texts were obtained from the Project Gutenberg archives. A
total of 387 texts were obtained from 45 authors who had more than one
text included in the archive; the details of authors and
classifications are given in Appendix <a href="#app:1">B</a>. One randomly chosen
text from each author was held out to make up an initial test set. The
results from comparing these texts with the 45 authors are given in
the first two columns of Table <a href="#tab:cvres">1</a>. Thirty-three texts
were correctly classified, while another 5 had rank 1, i.e. the
correct author was the second choice. The mean of the ranked values is
E(R<sub>k</sub>) = 1.681. Given that there are 45 texts to be assigned, the
correct assignment of 73.3% of them represents an error rate of just
0.687%.<a href="#tthFtNtAAC" name="tthFrefAAC"><sup>2</sup></a>

A full cross-validation was also carried out, where each text in turn
is left out of the analysis, then the authorship of this text is
predicted from the other data. The third column of the table in
Appendix <a href="#app:1">B</a> details the average rank obtained for texts from
each author. Of the 387 texts and 45 possible authors, 288 texts are
correctly classified. The full results are presented in the second

3.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the Cave of Shadows</h3>
In a study of how authorial discrimination may be improved by the use
of syntactic data, Baayen et al.&nbsp;(1996) examined
ten samples of text from each of two known authors, Innes and
Allingham. Of the twenty samples, the provenance of fourteen was known
to the experimenters, the remaining six had to be assigned to one of
the two authors. Baayen et al. use principal components analyses of
frequently occurring words, measures of lexical richness, and rare
constructions to identify the authors of the six text samples. While
Baayen et al.&nbsp;apply their methods to both the syntactic and lexical
vocabulary, we will just consider the lexical data since a transition
matrix of syntax rules would be too large to deal with. The two sets
of attributed text samples will form the training set, while the
unassigned samples will form the test set.

<p>
Cross-validation gives perfect results; all of the texts known to be
by author A (Innes) are classified as being by Innes, and the samples
from author B (Allingham) are all classified as being by Allingham.
The allocation of the six samples to be classified and their correct
attributions, shown in parentheses, are A (A), B (B), A (B), A (A), B
(B) and A (A) respectively. Five of the six samples have been
correctly assigned to their authors, which compares favourably with
similar results reported by Baayen et al.&nbsp;when using measures of
lexical richness (four out of six classified correctly) and frequently
occurring words (five out of six). Inspection of the probabilities
realised by the transition matrices shows that the difference between
the attributions has an average of 0.0060 and a standard deviation of
0.0028. The third text, which was mis-classified, gives rise to a
difference of only 0.00038. This technique therefore performs as well
as any of the methods applied to the lexical data by Baayen et al.

</p><p>
      </p><h3><a name="tth_sEc3.3">
3.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Federalist Papers</h3>
The <em>Federalist Papers</em> were written in 1787 and 1788 to persuade
the citizens of New York State to adopt the nascent Constitution of
the United States. From their initial use by Mosteller and Wallace in
1964, through research by McColly and Weier (1983)
to recent work by Holmes and Forsyth (1995) and Tweedie et al.&nbsp;(1996),
they have become somewhat of a test case for new methods of authorship
attribution.

<p>
There are 85 texts, of which 52 were written entirely by Hamilton and
14 entirely by Madison, with 12 papers that are disputed between these
two authors. A further three texts were written jointly by Hamilton
and Madison. The remaining texts were written by Jay and we shall not
consider these texts here. The texts known to be by either Hamilton or
Madison will form the training set, while the disputed and joint
papers will make up the test set.

</p><p>
When individual texts are held out for cross-validation purposes, we
find that four out of the fourteen Madison papers are classified as
being by Hamilton, while only two out of the 52 Hamilton papers are
misclassified. This overall misclassification rate of 9% is quite
acceptable for cross-validation.

</p><p>
All of the disputed papers are assigned by the Markov chain to
Madison, a result consistent with that of Mosteller and Wallace and
subsequent researchers. In addition, the joint papers, i.e. numbers 18
to 20, are classified as being by Madison, Hamilton and Madison,
respectively.

</p><p>
Mosteller and Wallace (1964) also assign paper 18 to Madison, although
Tweedie et al.'s neural network assigns it to Hamilton. The latter
note that very few of their eleven function words actually occur in
the text. A technique such as the one presented here which deals with
letter bigrams will not have this problem, and hopefully give rise to
more accurate results.

</p><p>
Our technique assigns paper 19 to Hamilton, although the probabilities
differ only by 0.0007, in comparison with the average difference of
0.0048 for the undisputed papers. Mosteller and Wallace conclude that
the majority of the paper was written by Madison, and Tweedie et al's
neural network also assigns the text to Madison.

</p><p>
Finally, for paper 20, Tweedie et al.&nbsp;(1996) cite Bourne (1901) writing

</p><blockquote>
  Fully nine-tenths
of it is drawn from Madison's own abstract of Sir William Temple's
<em>Observations upon the United Provinces </em> and of Fetice's <em>
Code de l'Humanit&#233;</em> ...  Sir William Temple's claim to be
recognized as joint author of No. 20 is far stronger than
Hamilton's.
</blockquote>
They conclude that Temple's influence is the reason that the paper is
assigned to Hamilton; our method assigns the text, perhaps more
accurately, to Madison.

<p>
        </p><h2><a name="tth_sEc4">
4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussion and Conclusions</h2>
In the section above we have considered three data sets which
illustrate the versatility of our proposed technique. Many studies of
authorship attribution are limited by the small number of texts that
are considered, with valid questions about their generalisability. To
address this, our first data set was made up of 387 texts from 45
authors, 74.42% of which were correctly classified. If we treat as
correct an author being in the top three selected, the success rate
goes up to 83.72%, a quite remarkable result. Khmelev (2000) reports
similar results with texts written in Russian.

<p>
To test the method on data in the literature we considered two
previously published cases. Our technique performs at least as well as
any used by Baayen et al.&nbsp;(1996) on the lexical data, and correctly
assigns the disputed <em>Federalist Papers</em>. This sucess is
particularly reassuring given the change in magnitude of the sample
sizes, from hundreds of thousands of words in the Project Gutenberg
archive data to around ten thousand in the Cave of Shadows data to
around one thousand words in the <em>Federalist Papers</em>.

</p><p>
The data used for the Markov Chain can perhaps be described as
linguistically microscopic - the unit is too small for meaningful
conclusions to be reached regarding characteristics of the texts by
the individual authors.  Comparison of transition matrices may allow
the researcher to comment that Hamilton uses `p' followed by `a' more
than Madison, for example, but this does not add to the stylistic
interpretation of the texts.

</p><p>
Such letter sequences may also be dependent on the subject of the
texts. Improved results may be obtained by removing context-dependent
words and performing the analysis only on function words, or very
frequent words. Another possibility, along the lines of Baayen et al.&nbsp;
(1996), would be to examine the transitions between parts of speech
used, thus tapping in to the syntactic structure of the text and
avoiding any dependence on context. This research is ongoing and
some results are presented in Kuskushkina et al.
(2001).
